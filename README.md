Getting Started
----------------

#### Installing all dependencies
##### If you just cloned this project, you must have NodeJS and NPM installed beforehand

Run **_npm install_** from the base of the repository


Running Developement Server
---------------------------
###### Once you have installed all the packages necessary, nodemon will automatically restarts server any time changes are made to the files 
###### This is really convenient
###### Type **_localhost:8000_** into your browser
###### If this port changes, you can see it at the top of app.js

Run **_npm run dev-server_**

When making changes to CSS/SCSS
-------------------------------
###### I have installed node-sass as a developer dependency. Run:

**_node-sass public/scss -o public/scss --source-map public/scss_**
