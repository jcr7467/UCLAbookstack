## Getting Started

### Installing all dependencies
#### If you just cloned this project, you must have NodeJS and NPM installed beforehand

Run _npm install_ from the base of the repository


### Running Developement Server
#### Once you have installed all the packages necessary
#### This will run nodemon, which automatically restarts server any time changes are made to the files
#### This is really convenient
#### Open on localhost:8000
#### If this port changes, you can see it at the top of app.js

Run _npm run dev-server_

# To compile scss, I have installed node-sass as a developer dependency. Run:

node-sass public/scss -o public/scss --source-map public/scss
