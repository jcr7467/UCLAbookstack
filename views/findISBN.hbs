            <h5>What is an ISBN?</h5>
            <p>ISBN is the acronym for International Standard Book Number. This 10 or 13-digit number identifies a specific book, an edition of a book, or a book-like product (such as an audiobook). Since 1970 each published book has a unique ISBN. In 2007,
                assigned ISBNs changed from 10 digits to 13. ISBNs are useful when looking for a specific printing of a book. A student, for example, can search by ISBN to find the correct edition of a textbook for school.</p>
            <h5>Finding the ISBN number on a book</h5>
            <p>On most books, the ISBN number can be found on the back cover, next to the barcode. If a book doesn't show the ISBN on the back cover, look on the page featuring the copyright and publisher information and the ISBN will be found there.</p><img
